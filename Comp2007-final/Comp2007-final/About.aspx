        <p>
            Hello, this application was a school project made by Jean-Claude Benard. I'm currently in my second year in the computer programmer course at Georgian 
            College. This application was made in ASP using bootstrap for styling with azure as the hosting platform.
        </p>
        <p>
            The primary point of this application is to let people make events for an mmo and join them taking into acount the things surrounding that.
            The biggest feature for this is the number of memebers needed for each role and the number currently signed up for them. This feature 
            can help groups organize more effectivly then just a regular planner.
        </p>
